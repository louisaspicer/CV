Curiosity and ambition lead me out of a job as a Digital Producer and into an intensive 12 weeks at the Makers Academy bootcamp, in order to pursue a career in Software Development which will fulfil my eagerness to continually learn and create.

The intersection of technology and creativity can be seen as a recurring theme in all of my work and education experiences from a young age. For me, Software Development lies perfectly at this intersection, as it is a craft where creativity can thrive and innovative products are built - and this is what really excites me.

Having no prior coding experience before studying at Makers Academy, I have quickly progressed as a Full Stack Junior Developer, shaped by best practices, XP, Test Driven Development and Pair Programming. I hope to find a Junior Developer role in a supportive environment that also recognises the importance and value of following similar practices.

#### Quick Learner

My experience at both Premier Comms and Makers Academy has proven that I am capable of learning and adapting quickly to a range of tasks. To ensure I was making the most of my time at Premier, I asked to help out in other departments, such as Digital Encoding and QC. Efficiently learning these new skills in a short period of time meant that I could help out in other departments when required.

#### Organisation and Time Management

As a Digital Producer, I managed the full lifecycle of various digital projects at one time. This required having effective time management and being highly organised, both physically and mentally.

Effective use of these skills lead me to be promoted from Assistant Producer in a few months after joining, as I could be relied upon to produce a greater amount of accurate work in a shorter period of time.

#### Attention to Detail

Being meticulous is one of the main reasons why I was able to progress and develop my job role throughout my time at Premier Comms. Soon after joining the digital team, this skill was recognised and I was entrusted with the responsibility to audit and create metadata files before they were used for platform deliveries.

The producers continually used me as a primary resource to check and/or create documents for clients, as I was able to use my keen eye for detail to quickly spot errors. This skill has come through in many different subjects, from placing importance on pleasant composition in the little details in Photography, Film and Graphic Design, to thoroughly scanning lines of data and code.

Exploring how the main characters represent aspects of Freud's theory of the Id, Ego and Superego, as well as the the life and death drives. I sought to re-establish Freud’s workings of the psyche through a different context to which he originally applied them. Here I merged psychoanalytic film theory with animation theory, a combination that has been widely neglected.

  Client lead for multiple projects, overseeing and co-ordinating asset management, encoding, QC and delivery of digital assets. Communicated with both clients and the team of digital encoders, operators and editors to achieve the smoothest possible process for delivery of content.
