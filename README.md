My love for the intersection between technology and creativity is apparent throughout all of my work and education experiences (both self-taught and at school) from a young age. For me, Software Development lies perfectly at this intersection, as it is a craft where creativity can thrive and innovative products are built. I'm really excited about furthering my knowledge and gaining a deeper understanding of how technology is working behind the scenes, so I am currently seeking a Junior Developer role where I can continue to learn and create.

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp, where I have learnt to code through best practices such as TDD, pair programming and religiously following Agile principles. Designing well-crafted code is something that has become a focus of my development and it would be great to find a place of work that values software craftmanship as much as I do.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Quick Learner

My experience at both Premier Comms and Makers Academy has proven that I am capable of learning and adapting quickly to a range of tasks. To ensure I was making the most of my time at Premier, I asked to help out in other departments, such as Digital Encoding and QC. Efficiently learning these new skills in a short period of time meant that I could help out in other departments when required.

#### Organisation and Time Management

As a Digital Producer, I managed the full lifecycle of various digital projects at one time. This required having effective time management and being highly organised, both physically and mentally.

As a result of these skills, I was promoted from Assistant Producer just a few months after joining, as I could be relied upon to produce a greater amount of accurate work in a short period of time.

#### Attention to Detail

Being meticulous is one of the main reasons why I was able to progress and develop my job role throughout my time at Premier Comms. Soon after joining the digital team, this skill was recognised and I was entrusted with the responsibility to audit and create metadata files before they were used for platform deliveries.

This skill has come through in many different subjects, from placing importance on pleasant composition in the little details in Photography, Film and Graphic Design, to thoroughly scanning lines of data and code.
